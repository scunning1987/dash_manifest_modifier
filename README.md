# dash_manifest_modifier
This code is designed to modify the contents of an MPEG DASH manifest as part of a LIVE PROXY workflow, or as an offline/static manifest rewrite. The purpose of the code is to get the DASH manifest (produced by a transcoder or packager) to conform to the requirements of downstream components or players.
